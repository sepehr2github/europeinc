    title: "What is EU Inc? The Complete Guide to the 28th Regime",
    excerpt:
      "Everything you need to know about the new pan-European company structure — how it works, who it's for, and why it matters for European business.",

      "The European Union is on the brink of its most significant business reform in decades. EU Inc, officially known as the '28th regime,' is a new pan-European legal entity framework that will allow entrepreneurs to register a single company that operates seamlessly across all 27 EU member states.",
      "Announced by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2026, EU Inc addresses one of Europe's most persistent challenges: the fragmentation of its business environment across 27 different national legal systems.",
      "## Why the 28th Regime?",
      "The name '28th regime' comes from the concept of creating a virtual 28th jurisdiction — one unified set of rules that exists alongside the 27 national legal systems. Unlike previous attempts at harmonization, EU Inc doesn't replace national company structures. Instead, it offers a new, parallel option specifically designed for businesses that want to operate across borders from day one.",
      "## Key Features of EU Inc",
      "The framework is built around several core principles that make it revolutionary for European business:",
      "**Digital-first registration**: The entire incorporation process is online, accessible from anywhere in the world. No physical presence, no notary appointments, no paper forms.",
      "**Minimal capital requirements**: With a minimum share capital of just €1, EU Inc removes one of the biggest barriers to starting a business in Europe. Compare this to the €25,000 required for a German GmbH or €37,000 for a French SA.",
      "**English as standard**: All documentation and registration is conducted in English at the EU level, eliminating language barriers that have historically complicated cross-border operations.",
      "**Unified governance**: One set of corporate governance rules applies across all member states, removing the need to navigate 27 different legal frameworks.",
      "## The Supporting Framework",
      "EU Inc doesn't exist in isolation. It's part of a broader ecosystem of tools designed to make pan-European business operations seamless:",
      "**EU-REGISTRY**: A central EU-level company registry where all EU Inc entities are registered and maintained, providing transparency and trust across borders.",
      "**EU-DASHBOARD**: A standardized entity management system where founders and investors can manage their company's legal status simply and transparently.",
      "**EU-FAST**: Harmonized investment documentation that standardizes the fundraising process across Europe, making it as straightforward as raising capital in the United States.",
      "**EU-ESOP**: An EU-wide stock options framework that enables companies to offer employee equity across borders without unexpected taxation events when talent moves between member states.",
      "## Timeline and What Comes Next",
      "The legislative proposal is expected from the European Commission in Q1 2026, followed by negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council of 27 member states throughout 2026. First registrations are anticipated in Q1 2027.",
      "## How Europe Inc Can Help",
      "At Europe Inc, we're preparing to be among the first service providers to help companies incorporate under the new EU Inc framework. From choosing the right entity structure to registration, compliance, and ongoing management across all 27 member states, we'll handle the complexity so you can focus on building your business.",

    excerpt:
      "A comprehensive comparison of the new EU Inc structure with the popular US LLC for international entrepreneurs expanding across borders.",
    date: "Jan 24, 2026",
    readTime: "10 min read",
    content: [
      "For international entrepreneurs, choosing where to incorporate is one of the most consequential decisions they'll make. For years, the US LLC — particularly the Delaware LLC — has been the default choice for global startups. But with EU Inc on the horizon, European incorporation is about to become a serious contender.",
      "## The US LLC Advantage",
      "The Delaware LLC has long been the gold standard for startup incorporation, and for good reason. It offers a well-established legal framework, access to US capital markets, a business-friendly court system, and global recognition. The process is straightforward, inexpensive, and can be completed in days.",
      "However, incorporating in the US from abroad comes with challenges: you'll need a registered agent, US tax obligations can be complex, and operating in Europe from a US entity means navigating international regulations.",
      "## Enter EU Inc",
      "EU Inc is designed to offer many of the same advantages the Delaware LLC provides — but for the European market. Here's how they compare:",
      "**Formation speed**: Both offer rapid digital registration. US LLCs can be formed in 1-2 days; EU Inc targets fast online registration as well.",
      "**Capital requirements**: Delaware LLCs have no minimum capital requirement. EU Inc requires just €1 — effectively the same.",
      "**Market access**: A US LLC gives you access to the American market (330M consumers). An EU Inc gives you access to the European single market (450M+ consumers) with a single entity.",
      "**Language**: US LLCs operate in English. EU Inc operates in English at the EU level — a first for European company structures.",
      "**Investment framework**: US LLCs benefit from standardized investment documentation (SAFEs, convertible notes). EU Inc includes EU-FAST, a harmonized investment documentation framework designed to bring the same standardization to Europe.",
      "**Employee equity**: Stock options in US companies are well-understood. EU Inc introduces EU-ESOP, harmonizing stock option treatment across 27 countries — solving one of Europe's biggest pain points for startups.",
      "## Which Should You Choose?",
      "If your primary market is the United States, a US LLC remains the natural choice. If you're building for Europe — or want to operate across European markets — EU Inc will likely be the better option once it launches.",
      "For truly global businesses, having both structures may make sense. Many international companies already maintain entities in multiple jurisdictions.",
      "## The Bottom Line",
      "EU Inc represents Europe's answer to the Delaware LLC. It won't replace the US structure overnight, but for European-focused businesses, it will offer a dramatically simpler, more efficient path to pan-European operations than anything available today.",
      "Europe Inc is here to help you navigate both options and choose the best structure for your business goals. Join our waitlist for personalized guidance.",

      "EU Inc for Non-EU Residents: Start a European Company From Anywhere",
    excerpt:
      "How entrepreneurs outside the EU can leverage the new 28th regime to access the European single market without residency requirements.",
    date: "Jan 23, 2026",
    readTime: "8 min read",
    content: [
      "One of the most groundbreaking aspects of EU Inc is its accessibility to entrepreneurs worldwide. Unlike many existing European company structures that require local directors, physical offices, or residency permits, EU Inc is designed to be truly global from the ground up.",
      "## No Residency Required",
      "EU Inc is explicitly designed to welcome entrepreneurs from outside the European Union. The entire process is digital, meaning you can incorporate your pan-European company from Tokyo, São Paulo, San Francisco, or anywhere else in the world. There's no requirement for EU citizenship, residency, or even a physical presence in Europe.",
      "## The Digital-First Approach",
      "The registration process is built around a fully digital workflow. Identity verification is handled through secure online systems, documents are submitted electronically, and the entire incorporation can be completed remotely. This represents a fundamental shift from the traditional European approach, where notary visits, apostilled documents, and in-person meetings have been the norm.",
      "## What You'll Need",
      "While the exact requirements will be finalized with the legislative proposal, the framework is designed to be straightforward:",
      "**Digital identification**: Valid passport or national ID for identity verification through the online system.",
      "**Company details**: Your company name, business description, and proposed structure.",
      "**Minimal capital**: Just €1 in share capital to get started.",
      "**No local director requirement**: Unlike many national structures, EU Inc is expected to allow directors from anywhere in the world.",
      "## Accessing the European Single Market",
      "For non-EU entrepreneurs, the biggest advantage of EU Inc is immediate access to the European single market — 450 million consumers across 27 countries with a single legal entity. No subsidiaries, no local incorporations, no navigating 27 different legal systems.",
      "This is particularly valuable for technology companies, e-commerce businesses, and service providers that can serve European customers remotely. Instead of picking one EU country and dealing with cross-border complications later, you start with pan-European coverage from day one.",
      "## Tax and Employment Considerations",
      "While EU Inc creates a unified legal entity, taxation and employment law remain at the national level. This means you'll pay taxes in the countries where you have economic activity, and employment contracts follow local labor law. Europe Inc can help you navigate these requirements across all 27 member states.",
      "## How Europe Inc Helps Non-EU Founders",
      "We specialize in helping international entrepreneurs incorporate in Europe. From entity selection to compliance across multiple jurisdictions, we handle the complexity so you can focus on your business. Join our waitlist to be among the first non-EU founders to incorporate under EU Inc.",

    title: "EU-ESOP Explained: The New Stock Options Framework for Europe",
    excerpt:
      "How the harmonized EU-wide stock options framework will help European startups attract and retain top talent across all 27 member states.",
    date: "Jan 20, 2026",
    readTime: "7 min read",
    content: [
      "One of the most impactful components of the EU Inc framework isn't the company structure itself — it's EU-ESOP, the harmonized employee stock options framework that will transform how European startups attract and retain talent.",
      "## The Current Problem",
      "Today, stock options in Europe are a nightmare. Each of the 27 EU member states has different rules for how stock options are taxed, when they vest, and what happens when an employee moves between countries. A developer in Berlin who accepts stock options from a French startup faces completely different tax treatment than their colleague in Amsterdam.",
      "This fragmentation has real consequences. European startups struggle to compete with US companies for talent because they can't offer globally competitive equity packages. And when European employees move between countries — which should be a fundamental right in the single market — they can face unexpected and punitive tax events on their unvested options.",
      "## What EU-ESOP Changes",
      "EU-ESOP creates a single, harmonized framework for employee stock options across all EU member states. The key principles include:",
      "**Consistent tax treatment**: Stock options granted under EU-ESOP will follow standardized tax rules regardless of which member state the employee works in.",
      "**Portability**: Employees can move between EU countries without triggering unexpected tax events on their equity. This is crucial for the free movement of workers within the single market.",
      "**Standardized vesting**: Common vesting schedules and exercise mechanisms reduce complexity for both companies and employees.",
      "**Transparency**: Clear, understandable documentation in English ensures employees know exactly what their equity is worth and how it works.",
      "## Impact on Talent Acquisition",
      "EU-ESOP will level the playing field between European and American startups when it comes to talent competition. European companies will finally be able to offer equity packages that are:",
      "Easily understood by candidates across all EU countries, portable when talent moves between offices or relocates, and consistently taxed without cross-border surprises.",
      "## For Founders",
      "If you're building a pan-European team, EU-ESOP means you can design a single equity plan that works across all 27 member states. No more country-by-country legal opinions, no more complex multi-jurisdiction tax advice for every hire, and no more losing candidates because your equity offer is too complicated to understand.",
      "## Timeline",
      "EU-ESOP is part of the broader EU Inc legislative proposal expected in Q1 2026. It will be implemented alongside the EU Inc entity, with the full framework expected to be available by Q1 2027.",
      "Europe Inc will offer EU-ESOP setup and management as part of our incorporation services. Join our waitlist to learn more.",
